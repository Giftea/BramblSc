Welcome to the **Brambl SDK**! This SDK is designed to help developers interact with the Brambl blockchain network efficiently. 
In this guide, we'll walk you through setting up the SDK in your Scala project, explore key components like the `ServiceKit`, and provide 
useful resources to help you contribute to the project.

## Installation
The Brambl SDK is built for Scala 2.13 and is available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/brambl-sdk_2.13). 
To include it in your Scala project, first ensure you have [Scala Build Tool (SBT)](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html) installed. 

Then, add the following lines to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala title="build.sbt"
val bramblVersion = "2.0.0" // Replace with the latest version

libraryDependencies += "co.topl" %% "brambl-sdk" % bramblVersion
```

:::tip
Always check for the latest version of Brambl SDK [here](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/co.topl/brambl-sdk_2.13/versions). 
We recommend using the latest version for optimal performance and security.
:::

### Verify Installation
To verify the SDK is installed correctly, try running the following basic Scala program:

```scala
object Main extends App {
  println("Brambl SDK is installed and ready!")
}
```

If the program runs and prints the message, you're good to go! ðŸŽ‰

## Service Kit

The Brambl SDK comes equipped with a powerful <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/servicekit/index.html"><code>ServiceKit</code></ScaladocLink> that manages wallet functionality and data persistence. 
It implements traits from the <ScaladocLink path="co/topl/brambl/dataApi/index.html"><code>DataApi</code></ScaladocLink> package that may not be covered by the default SDK setup. The SDK provides a default implementation that handles data storage using local storage and SQLite.

To use the Service Kit, add the following dependency to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala title="build.sbt"
val bramblVersion = "2.0.0" // Replace with the latest version

libraryDependencies += "co.topl" %% "service-kit" % bramblVersion
```

For more detailed information, check out the [Service Kit Overview](../service-kit/big-picture).


### Other Libraries

There are 3 other libraries relevant to the SDK; [`crypto`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/crypto_2.13),
[`quivr4s`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/quivr4s_2.13),
and [`protobuf`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/co.topl/protobuf-fs2_2.13). These libraries are not required to be added
to a project since they are mainly meant to be used internally by the SDK. However, advanced users may find them useful
to use to implement their own custom functionality in their application.

## Contributing

The Brambl SDK is completely open source and we welcome contributions. To get started, check out
